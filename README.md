# LightweightFineTuningProject


This repository is for the lightweight Fine-tuning of a LLM using PEFT. It contains the following:

1. Find a dataset for sequence classification,
2. Evaluate the dataset with a pre-trained foundation model,
3. Fine-tune the foundation model using PEFT and Lora method,
4. Evaluate the dataset with the fine-tuned model.
