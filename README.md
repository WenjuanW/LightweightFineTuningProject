# LightweightFineTuningProject


This repository is for the lightweight Fine-tuning of a LLM using PEFT. It contains the following:

1. Load a dataset for sequence classification,
2. Load gpt2 and it's tokenizer
3. Tokenize the dataset
4. Train the classification head for the gpt2 model and evaluate
5. Fine-tune the gpt2 model whole and evaluate
6. Fine-tune the gpt2 model with peft method and evaluate
7. Load the peft model and evaluate
